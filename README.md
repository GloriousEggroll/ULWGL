# ULWGL
Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher


# THIS REPO HAS MOVED
This project is now part of OWC -- https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/ULWGL

ULWGL -- A clone of the steam runtime tools and steam runtime container for use outside of steam, is now part of OWC (Open Wine Components).  Moving forward work will be continued in that repo


# WHAT IS THIS?

This is a work in progress POC (proof of concept) for a unified launcher for windows games on linux. It is essentially a copy of the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools (https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools) that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam.

# WHAT DOES IT DO?

When steam launches a proton game, it launches it like this:

```
/home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/reaper SteamLaunch AppId=348550 -- /home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-launch-wrapper -- /home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper/_v2-entry-point --verb=waitforexitandrun -- /home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton8-27/proton waitforexitandrun /home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R/GGXXACPR_Win.exe
```

We can ignore this `/home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-launch-wrapper`, it's just a process runner with no real value other than forwarding environment variables (more on that later).

I managed to pull the envvars it uses by making steam run printenv for the games command line. We needed these envvars because proton expects them in order to function. With them we can essentially make proton run without needing steam at all.

Next this part `/home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper/_v2-entry-point`

The first part `/home/tcrider/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper/` is steam-runtime-tools compiled https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools and is used alongside the sniper runtime container used during proton builds.

The second part `_v2-entry-point` is just a bash script which loads proton into the container and runs the game.

So, ULWGL is basically a copy paste of SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper, which is a compiled version of steam-runtime-tools. We've renamed _v2-entry-point to ULWGL and added `gamelauncher.sh` to replace steam-launch-wrapper.

When you use `gamelauncher.sh` to run a game, it uses the specified WINEPREFIX, proton version, executable, and arguements passed to it to run the game in proton, inside steam's runtime container JUST like if you were running the game through Steam, except now you're no longer limited to Steam's game library or forced to add the game to Steam's library, in fact, you don't even have to have steam installed.

# HOW DO I USE IT?

Usage:
  `WINEPREFIX=/path-to-prefix GAMEID=makeoneup ./gamelauncher.sh <proton-path> <executable-path> <arguements>`
Ex:
  `WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Games/epic-games-store GAMEID=egs ./gamelauncher.sh "$HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton8-28" "$HOME/Games/epic-games-store/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32/EpicGamesLauncher.exe" "-opengl -SkipBuildPatchPrereq"`

# WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OTHER LAUNCHERS (lutris/bottles/heroic/legendary,etc):

- everyone can use + contribute to the same protonfixes, no more managing individual install scripts per launcher
- everyone can run their games through proton just like a native steam game
- no steam or steam binaries required
- a unified online database of game fixes (protonfixes)

right now protonfixes packages a folder of 'gamefixes' however it could likely be recoded to pull from online quite easily

The idea is to get all of these tools using this same `gamelauncher.sh` and just feeding their envvars into it. That way any changes that need to happen can happen in proton-ge and/or protonfixes, or a 'unified proton' build based off GE, or whatever they want.

# WHAT IS THE BASIC PLAN OF PUTTING THIS INTO ACTION?

1. We build a database containing various game titles, their IDs from different stores, and their correlating ULWGL ID.
2. Various launchers then search the database to pull the ULWGL ID, and feed it as the game ID to gamelauncher.sh alongside the store type, proton version, wine prefix, game executable, and launch arguements.
3. When the game gets launched from gamelauncher.sh, protonfixes picks up the store type and ULWGL ID and finds the appropriate fix script for it, then applies it before running the game.
4. protonfixes has folders separated for each store type. The ULWGL ID for a game remains the exact same across multiple stores, the only difference being it can have store specific scripts OR it can just symlink to another existing script that already has the fixes it needs.

Example:

Borderlands 3 from EGS store.
1. Generally a launcher is going to know which store it is using already, so that is easy enough to determine and feed the STORE variable to the launcher.
2. To determine the game title, EGS has various codenames such as 'Catnip'. The launcher would see "ok store is egs and codename is Catnip, let's search the ULWGL database for those"
3. In our ULWGL unified database, we create a 'title' column, 'store' column, 'codename' column, 'ULWGL-ID' column. We add a line for Borderlands 3 and fill in the details for each column.
4. Now the launcher can search 'Catnip' and 'egs' as the codename and store in the database and correlate it with Borderlands 3 and ULWGL-12345. It can then feed ULWGL-12345 to the gamelauncher.sh script.


README notes from Valve's steam-runtime-tools:

Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper)
================================

This container-based release of the Steam Runtime is used for native
Linux games, and for Proton 8.0+.

For general information please see
<https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/container-runtime.md>
and

Development and debugging
-------------------------

The runtime's behaviour can be changed by running the Steam client with
environment variables set.

`STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_LOG=1` will enable logging. Log files appear in
`SteamLinuxRuntime_sniper/var/slr-*.log`, with filenames containing the app ID.
`slr-latest.log` is a symbolic link to whichever one was created most
recently.

`STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_VERBOSE=1` produces more detailed log output,
either to a log file (if `STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_LOG=1` is also used) or to
the same place as `steam` output (otherwise).

`PRESSURE_VESSEL_SHELL=instead` runs an interactive shell in the
container instead of running the game.

Please see
<https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/distro-assumptions.md>
for details of assumptions made about the host operating system, and some
advice on debugging the container runtime on new Linux distributions.

Game developers who are interested in targeting this environment should
